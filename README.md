# kevinhogue-arrest-rates-in-FL

Data shows arrest rates per 100,000 people by county in Florida, from 1998-2015.
FlordiaAverage is the average arrest rate across the entire state during this 18 year time period.

Couple things i need to work on:
1. work on getting my %change state worked out using the FL state average.  I am planning on doing this in an info window and or tooltip or popup.
2. I might change up the style of the map, the base map in particular.
